# Overview
Configspec is a configuration loading library for Python that supports smart environment variable interpolation at runtime.

It provides a simple way to load configuration from common formats like `YAML`, `JSON`, and `TOML`, while being easy
to add support for any additional formats. Out-of-the-box, configspec supports parsing application configuration
into Pydantic models, or Msgspec Structs.

The environment variable interpolation syntax allows you to keep your defaults in the configuration file, while
still being able to override them from a deployment environment.

## Installation
Configspec is available on PyPI and can be installed using your package manager of choice.

```bash
pip install configspec
```
```bash
uv add configspec
```

## Usage
`config.toml`
```toml
[server]
port = "${PORT:8080}"
debug = "${DEBUG:false}"

[database]
url = "postgres://${DB_URL:postgres:postgres@localhost:5432}/postgres"

[logging]
level = "${LOG_LEVEL~:INFO}"
handlers = "${LOG_HANDLERS[,]:console,file}"

[features]
enabled = "${FEATURE_FLAGS[,]:auth,metrics,caching}"
```

The above configuration file can easily be loaded, with any environment substitution happening automatically.
```python
>>> import configspec
>>> configspec.load("config.toml")
{
    "server": {
        "port": "8080",
        "debug": "false"
    },
    "database": {
        "url": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"
    },
    "logging": {
        "level": "INFO",
        "handlers": ["console", "file"]
    },
    "features": {
        "enabled": ["auth", "metrics", "caching"]
    }
}
```

Or if you wanted it to be loaded into a msgspec Struct object. Note that msgspec will coerce some fields
into the requested types automatically, unless you pass `strict=True`.
```python
>>> import configspec
>>> import msgspec

>>> class Server(msgspec.Struct):
...    port: int
...    debug: bool

>>> class Database(msgspec.Struct):
...    url: str

>>> class Logging(msgspec.Struct):
...    level: str
...    handlers: list[str]

>>> class Features(msgspec.Struct):
...    enabled: list[str]

>>> class Config(msgspec.Struct):
...    server: Server
...    database: Database
...    logging: Logging
...    features: Features

>>> configspec.load("config.toml", cls=Config)
Config(
    server=Server(port=8080, debug=False),
    database=Database(url='postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres'),
    logging=Logging(level='INFO', handlers=['console', 'file']),
    features=Features(enabled=['auth', 'metrics', 'caching'])
)
```
